# Widget
I'ma build a little widget to experiment with. Woo-hoo!

Okay, this README was previously about how I'm a novice at Git. Still true, but I'm getting it _(oof, sloppy pun)_. Onto the goods with this widget.

I'm working on a project which I'll be posting soon which is a piece of business agnostic scheduling software. It will, at some length, allow any small business to schedule employees based on seniority and preference, _in that order_. 

That program is getting kinda unweildy for working out some of the base logic. So, I'm making a toy program that is similar, but simpler. I have a notion that I may continually use this same widget to work out little logic play. So, I'm going to try to make something very general. Though, I won't go out of my way too far.
