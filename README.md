# Widget
I'ma build a little widget to experiment with. Woo-hoo!

Really, I've been a pretty poor git user in the two years since joining GitHub and starting to use git. I actually just use it as a save system. I'm never even rolled back to a previous commit or merged branches. I've only actually ever used branching to experiment with ideas and then just gone back and worked on the main branch of my projects. I've also only used git locally in the command line. I've not done any collaborating or pushed and pulled even to my various machines and servers. It's pretty sad, right. 

So, as a way of bettering my Git-Fu I am currently adding content on my mobile-local machine, having cloned the repository via the command line. Next up, pushing back to Git Hub.

Okay, now - from my desktop-local machine I have cloned the repo. Added a file in which I'd like to build my widget, and pushed some changes back up to the repo on GH. I feel like I don't totally suck at this. That's cool.
